# OnlineCourseCatalog

Mini Project

Project: Online Course Catalog

Objective:
Build a backend system using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL to manage an online course catalog with courses, lessons, and supporting materials.

Key Requirements:
•⁠  ⁠Implement APIs to perform CRUD operations for:
    * Courses (title, description, category, etc.)
    * Lessons within each course (title, content, duration)
    * Supporting materials attached to lessons, limited to:
        * PDF documents (e.g., manuals, guides)
        * Video links (e.g., tutorials, lectures)
•⁠  ⁠Allow filtering courses by category.
•⁠  ⁠Support user enrollment into courses via APIs.
•⁠  ⁠Include endpoints to:
    * Add, update, delete, and list courses, lessons, and supporting materials
    * Enroll users and list their enrolled courses
•⁠  ⁠Thoroughly test the system with unit and integration tests.
•⁠  ⁠(Optional) Add an endpoint to generate a PDF report listing all available courses.

Guidelines:
Create a new repository and raise PR on daily tasks.
Design the database schema based on these requirements.
Define the API structure and endpoint naming conventions.
Emphasize clean code, proper error handling, and good documentation.
